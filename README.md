# ROBIN

ROBIN is a **multi-college, execution-first student community** focused on
building, testing, and shipping real products through structured startup and
builder programs.

We exist to create disciplined environments where students execute consistently
—not just attend events.

---

## What We Do

- **Startup Execution Sprints**  
  Problem discovery → MVP → validation → internal demo

- **Builder Coding Program**  
  Technical execution supporting real products and experiments

- **Internal Reviews**  
  Documentation, accountability, and progress tracking

> Output matters more than attendance.

---

## What We Are Not

- Not a certificate club  
- Not a speaker or seminar series  
- Not a placement or recruitment cell  
- Not a funding or investor network  

---

## Structure

ROBIN operates through a structured, multi-college model:

- **Founder & Director (External)**
- **Managers** — Execution, Tech, Operations
- **College Leads** — internal student representatives
- **Core Project Teams** — execution-focused groups

Each college unit operates with faculty oversight and follows institutional
guidelines.

## How We Use GitHub

GitHub is our **execution layer**, not a marketing page.

- Each project lives in its own repository
- Contributions happen via pull requests
- Documentation is mandatory
- No direct pushes to `main`

Inactive or non-executing repos are archived.

---

## Who Should Contribute

ROBIN is for:
- builders who value execution over visibility
- students willing to commit consistent time
- contributors comfortable with accountability and review

If you are looking for certificates or quick recognition, ROBIN is not the right fit.

ROBIN is intentionally quiet, structured, and execution-driven.
